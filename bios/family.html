<h3>Our Mission</h3>

<p>
Bringing CS10 to the World! Better mission statement insert here!
</p>

<h3>Different Roles</h3>

<h4>Lecturer/Instructor/Professor</h4>
<p>Our Fearless Leader! The instructor keeps the course on track, writes the exams, gives the lectures,
ans helps make sure all students receive the material for the course.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In charge of TAs</li>
  <li>Lectures</li>
  <li>Writes Exams</li>
  <li>Deals with Admistrative Issues</li>
  <li>Holds Office Hours</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where do you fit in?</h3>
<p>As you can imagine, a class like CS10 take a lot of dedication and passion
to make it the best course on campus (and hopefully soon, the whole world).
As such, we need people like you, the stars of your class, strong, smart,
leadership prone individuals who want to help others learn about the value of
computer science to everyone in every field.</p>

<p> Often these individuals start as Lab Assistants getting units by regularly
attending a scheduled lab and helping students with their in lab questions.
During this time they can learn about the CS10 Family experience and they can
also join the TAiT program (TA in Training) where they can shadow a TA and
learn what kind of duties a TA holds, some tips for teaching, and more advanced
ideas about CS. Following this students can continue lab assisting or become a
Reader or a Content Developer, grading or making course materials respectively.
These paid positions help individuals learn the underworkings of CS10 and more
or the technical details of how a course like this strives to make CS education
open to all. Finally, individuals can advance into be a TA as positions open and
based on evaluations. Here they can learn they will participate in a UC Ethics
course (CS 301),  and learn responsibility for their students as well as public
speaking and error handling in discussions and labs. They also learn to handle
course organization and management duties expected of TAs at staff meetings and
the like.</p>

<p>Together, we can make a CS10 course for everyone everywhere become more
aware of the impact of computers in their lives and make a more CS educated
generation for the technology filled world of tomorrow.</p>
