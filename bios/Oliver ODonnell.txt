\f0\fs24 \cf0 WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?\
\
I grew up in Sydney, Australia, before moving to Dubai in 2007 with my family where I went to an American international school. Even though we came back to Sydney after 3 years I loved American culture (especially what I had heard about the Bay Area) and I was ready for another adventure. When I was accepted to Cal I couldn\'92t resist!\
\
HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?\
\
I had lots of fun with Snap! in cs 10, some python in 61a, and a little HTML via CodeAcademy.\
\
WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?\
\
I go on Reddit a lot, and I enjoy singing in the UC Men\'92s Chorale!\
\
WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?\
\
I can throw a frisbee pretty well, and I used to play Australian football - if you find a team in Berkeley tell me!\
\
HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?\
\
I\'92ve travelled a fair amount (Nairobi, Toulouse, Paris, NYC, Chicago, Chiangmai, Bali, Cairo, London, Madison, Hong Kong, Singapore) but I still haven\'92t been to Melbourne! In Dubai I got to meet Sharukh Khan once!\
\
WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?\
\
In addition to being a TAiT for CS10, I\'92ll be in the Student Advocate\'92s Office as a Caseworker, I\'92ll be in the UC Men\'92s Chorale this semester and probably a few to come (come to our concerts!), and of course I\'92ll be doing plenty of challenging work in my Math, CS, Public Health and Comparative Literature classes.}
