WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
   I've been a student intern at Sandia National Laboratories for the past four years. I'm working on algal and bacterial biofeuls research and development (R&D) in applied biology laboratories doing a bunch of wet lab work and data analysis having worked with cell cultures, spectroscopy, genetics, and molecular cloning. 

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
   From my work at my internship, I've co-authored an article in the Journal of Biotechnology and Bioengineering, titled "Multiplex fluorometric assessment of nutrient limitation as a strategy for enhanced lipid enrichment and harvesting in Neochloris Oleoabundans", which I think is pretty cool!
