WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?
I grew up in El Cerrito, which is literally a 10-minute BART ride away from
campus (long trek from home, I know). I went to El Cerrito High, and from there
went to Berkeley in Fall of 2010, which is also when I took the first offering of CS10!
I came in undeclared in L&S (heading towards an English route oddly enough), but after I took CS10,
I got hooked into programming, and am now in my final semester at Cal
as a Computer Science major! It's scary how time really does fly by.


HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?
My first language was Scratch/BYOB (which has now evolved into Snap!) when I took CS10.
After that I learned Scheme, Java, and C which I learned in CS61a, CS61b, and CS61c respectively.
I learned a lot of web development languages over the past few years,
so I've gotten fairly good at JavaScript, jQuery, WinJS, HTML5, CSS3, and Node.js.

I also know a decent amount of UNIX, Python (my faveorite!), and a little bit of Ruby.


WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I love to swim (did it competitively for 10 years!), discover new bands to
listen to (I'm a big music junkie), play guitar, and trying new restaurants!


WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?
Again, swimming is a big one. I made it to NCS and Far Westerns senior year of
high school, and had previously competed in the Junior Olympics. Guitar has been
something I picked up more recently, but it's my favorite way to relax.


HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?
At my last internship, I helped build a media app for a major TV network for the Xbox One!

Last semester, my group in Tangible UI built our own instrument, which was incredibly fun!
It was my first time working with Arduino microcontrollers, and I learned a lot about circuit building.
We named our instrument the PulsR, and you can check it out here (shameless plug): http://youtu.be/16Fs1-47Bxo

Also, I survived (and did pretty well in) CS61b with Professor Hilfinger.


WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?
In addition to being a TA for CS10, my (gasp!) final classes at Cal wil be CS 160 (User Interfaces),
CS 294 (Critical Making), UGBA 196 (Personal Finances) and L&S C180U (Wealth and Poverty).
I'll also keep Berkeley up to date with music as the Lead Music Critic for the Daily Californian,
and design creative projects with the human-centered design club Berkeley Innovations!
