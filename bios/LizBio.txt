WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I went to Salinas High School in the not-so-exciting Salinas, California.
Although I miss all the lettuce fields, Berkeley is about a hundred times
better and I’m thoroughly enjoying my second year here.

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
I had no experience before taking CS10 last semester, but after
discovering the wonders of computer science BYOB style I decided to take
CS61A so I’m currently learning Python.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
My hobbies include weight lifting, running, swimming, doodling,
Photoshopping, Sudoku, and reading. I usually fall asleep when TVs are on,
but occasionally I’ll watch “How I Met Your Mother” or “Here Comes Honey
Boo Boo.”

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
I can play the piano decently well, beat just about anyone in a straight
face staring contest, and my world records on the Playman Track & Field
iPhone app are pretty insane. I’m also very skilled in the art of face
swapping on Photoshop.

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I’ve done some world travelling (New Zealand, Canada, Croatia, Italy,
etc.) with my family, which is always cool, and I’ve done a ton of
memorable things with friends (I’d have to say running around Golden Gate
Park in a muumuu was one of the highlights of the past year). Oh and I
used to raise pigs every year for the fair, which is apparently really
random and kind of weird although I had no idea it was until I came to
college.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
My classes are keeping me pretty busy, but on top of those I’m working as
a ticket seller for Cal sporting events and as one of the weight room
staff in the RSF, I’m a member of Paws & Claws, and the rest of my time
goes to all the hobbies I listed above or hanging out with friends.
