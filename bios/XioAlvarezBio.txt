Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal? 

I grew up in suburban New Jersey in a small town outside New York City. When it came time for me to decide where to go to college, I wanted a new adventure with a new city. Cal and San Francisco were the perfect choice, I've never regretted it.

How much programming have you done (& what languages)?

I've been doing basic html and css programming for years (neopets in middle school actually taught me something, who'd have thought?). I've recently started learning python and working on updating my front end skills to be a bit more powerful considering what I learned in CS10. 

What are your hobbies?

I boulder (it's rock climbing, but the rocks are shorter and you don't need equipment), work with film and digital photography, and I like to draw and build things. 

What are some of your talents & skills?

I'm a pretty decent artist in traditional media. I also know a lot of random specific facts about things. 

Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?

In high school I backpacked across Costa Rica. I still think the coolest thing I've ever done was going out on a rope swing off of a cliff and over the rainforest. I was so terrified I couldn't bring myself to scream and it was completely breathtaking. 

What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?

I'm involved with BMUN (berkeley model united nations) and it's my pride and joy.
