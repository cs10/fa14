Where did you grow up?

I was born in India, and moved to Singapore when I was a toddler. I lived there for a couple years until I was finished with Kindergarten, at which point I moved to Santa Clara, California, where I've lived ever since. 

How much programming have you done (& what languages)?

I actually had no background in programming until I took CS10 this past summer. Right now, I'm taking CS61A where I'm learning python.

What are your hobbies?

I love to read, and I also watch a ton of TV shows! Some of my favorites include Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Suits, White Collar, and The Vampire Diaries.

What are some of your talents & skills?

I was captain of my debate team in high school so some skills that I learned from that include public speaking, argumentation and research. I also love to sing!

Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?

I had an internship last year where I learned how to do open heart surgical procedures including coronary artery bypass grafts and valve replacements. I also got to watch an open heart surgery and it was one of the coolest things I've ever witnessed!

What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?

This semester I hope to intern for the ASUC and for INDUS, and work with the EdX team on their CS10 project.
