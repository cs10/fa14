WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I was born in Chicago but moved to Orange County when I was little so I grew up in beautiful, sunny SoCal. I am currently a second year intending to double major in Economics and Computer Science.

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
I took CS10 in Spring 2013 (BEST CLASS EVER!) and am currently taking CS61A this fall so I know BYOB/SNAP and am learning Python right now.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I love to dance, eat, watch tv/movies, and go out with friends.

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
I have some really weird talents like being able to move my ears without using my hands and being able to hold an M&M/Skittle in my dimple.

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
Can't say that I've done anything too remarkable in my life so far but I did dive off a 50 foot cliff this past summer into a lake. So that was pretty cool... and painful.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
I'll be taking 3 technical classes this semester, lab assisting for this class, interning at Morgan Stanley, staying involved in my sorority, and helping plan Dance Marathon... so I'll definitely be very busy this semester to say the least.
