WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Eagle Rock, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, and I lived there throughout my childhood. I went to a performing arts high school in downtown Los Angeles, and I studied theatre there for three years. After high school, I came to Berkeley! This is my second year here, and I am currently studying Cognitive Science.

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I took CS10 in Spring 2013, and before that, I had no programming experience. I am currently taking CS61A and learning Python. As of now, I haven't even been programming for a full year.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I love hiking, and being outside in the wilderness. I also really enjoy acting and dancing! These are some of my favorite things to do.

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I can juggle! I can juggle balls, scarves, and pins, and I can also make balloon animals. I considered going to clown college, but I somehow ended up at Berkeley instead!

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I've gone backpacking! My dad and I spent four nights alone in the Eastern Sierras. That adventure was one of the most amazing accomplishments of my life.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
