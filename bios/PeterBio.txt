HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?

I have been programming for a couple years now. I've primarily used python, Scratch/BYOB and the statistical language R. I've also played around with scheme, BASIC, and Unix. I actually got my start programming in TI-BASIC on my TI-84 calculator. My first program estimated integrals using the trapezoid rule. I don't know if you could call it programming exactly, but I've also used HTML and LaTeX quite a bit.
