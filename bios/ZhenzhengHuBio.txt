WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grow up in the hometown of pandas! (Chengdu, China) If you don't know it, it is the one of the happiest place to live on earth: so many good spicy food, beautiful views, and restaurants and tea houses everywhere. At Cal, I am majoring Applied Mathematics with concentration in CS. 

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
Not much, except BYOB, some experience in Java and Matlab. 

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I have lots of hobbies; it is hard to say them in an organized way. For non-stationary hobbies, I love workouts (yoga, boxing, dance, etc.), going to movies, trying new restaurants, shopping, travelling, or just doing random things. For stationary hobbies, I love watching shows (Bones, Numb3ers, Suits are my favorite!) and talking. 

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENOTS & SKILLS?
Does talking count? My old roommate used to tell people that I can always talk to whoever she brings back, no matter how awkward it is. 

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
Remarkable? Depends on how you define it. Memorable? Uhm, I don't know, I tend to remember funny things or weird/awkward things happened. 

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
I am taking 17 units, have a part-time job at GWS (sounds bad but my schedule looks alright), involved in some organizations.
