- Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal? 

I spent the first ten years of my childhood in Taiwan but after 3rd grade I moved to Southern California, Arcadia (where two other lab assistants are also from), where I lived until I moved to Berkeley! Currently, I'm an intended Computer Science major sophomore and I took CS10 last Fall! 

I chose Berkeley because I wasn't sure what I was going to pursue and while Computer Science sounded awesome, I didn't know what exactly the field entailed. Coming in as an undeclared major gave me more flexibility (and sound of mind). Also, I thought that if I ended up studying CS, Cal would be a perfect place to do so!


- How much programming have you done (& what languages)?

I did not have any real programming experience until CS10. From there, I have taken CS61A and CS61B. So languages I know now include Python and Java. Currently I am starting to learn a bit of C, HTML5, and CSS. 


- What are your hobbies?

I spend my (meager) free time on Photoshop and Illustrator because I like to graphic design. I also really like dancing ballet, jazz, and contemporary. I also watch too much television shows for my gpa and like to read fiction books in mostly fantasy and the sci-fi genre. Oh, and I also like writing and pretending I'm an awesome photographer. 


- What are some of your talents & skills?

I can remember random details about people like their hobbies and hometown they told me weeks or even months ago but never their name. Does that count as a talent? (P.S. please don't be offended if I ask for your name multiple times).


- Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?

I aspire to one day do something remarkable and extraordinary. Right now, every time I do well in a class and understand something, that eureka! moment is pretty remarkable to me. (Wow, that sounds really sad). 

Making new friends is also always remarkable. So say hi and we can be friends. 


- What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?

CS and CS. Also I lead a team for Innovative Design, a graphic design club, and also write for Caliber magazine. Did I mention CS yet? I'm also in some other clubs. I'm pretty busy. You should see my multicolored Google calendar. There is this section I carved out especially for CS 10 though :)




tl;dr: Just come say hi! Don't be scared. I don't bite unless you're a cookie. I like cookies. I also ramble when I write, sorry.
