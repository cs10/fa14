Where did you grow up? What was your academic path?
I was born in Canada (let the Canadian jokes roll), lived in Chicago for a few years, and I've been in the Bay Area since. I’m a Cognitive Science major looking to minor in Peace and Conflict Studies.

How much programming have you done (& what languages)?
I’ve been programming for about a year— I recently learned Python and Scheme, and am looking forward to picking up more when I get the chance!

paying homage to the Lion King, frequently dancing to Shakira, gazing longingly at food photography, and exploring music and poetry of all kinds

What are some of your talents & skills?
I really enjoy singing, and can do a decent, if not somewhat creepy Elmo impression.

Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything really memorable happened to you? 
I just finished writing a fiction novel about modern-day atrocities in the wake of the Sri Lankan genocide, and the book is now in the super fun (painful) revising stage. If you're ever in the mood for a debriefing of human rights in Sri Lanka, I'm your gal. 

What commitments will be consuming your cycles this term?
writing, meditating, convincing myself that I don't hate Chemistry, research in the Hafter Auditory Perception Lab, and expanding my culinary abilities beyond making Nutella sandwiches
