Where did you grow up? What was your academic path? I was born in Chicago but
grew up in Arcadia, California, which is a suburb pretty close to Los Angeles.
I came into Cal not sure what I was going to do, took CS10 my first semester,
and decided to major in computer science.

How much programming have you done (& what languages)? I've been programming
for three years. I'm most experienced in Java and Python.

What are your hobbies? Drawing, designing, video-editing a bit, watching
movies, reading whatever I can get my hands on, and drinking too much tea
and/or coffee.

What are some of your talents & skills? I can tell the difference between
Helvetica and Arial, type at 120 words per minute, and fall asleep after having
a triple shot of espresso. Not all at the same time though.

Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything really memorable happened to
you? Once I was at the California Academy of Sciences and there was this large,
dark tank at floor level that looked totally empty. So I got really close to
look at it. My face was maybe a few inches from the glass before I realized I
was looking at an enormous, dead fish very, very close up. It's called a
coelacanth, if you're curious. Anyway I scared myself so badly I had to sit
down for a minute.

What commitments will be consuming your cycles this term? I'll be a part of
Innovative Design, Cal's biggest graphic design/web design/photography club.
I'm also hoping to get into the Web Design Decal, which should be fun!
