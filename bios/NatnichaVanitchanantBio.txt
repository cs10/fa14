WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up in Bangkok, Thailand where I went to Ruamrudee International School. I moved to the US last year to come to Cal (that makes me a current sophomore), and I am intending to major in Genetics and Plant Biology in CNR.

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
I took CS10 last spring (2013), so I know Scratch, BYOB, and Snap!. I'm currently taking CS 61A and am looking forward to learning Python this upcoming semester.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I was into competitive swimming and water polo back in high school, but haven't had much time for any of that ever since I came to Berkeley. Lately, I've been spending most of my free time baking and eating the things I bake.

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
Back in high school, I played water polo for the Thai National Team. Sadly enough, I had to leave all that behind for Berkeley. But I don't regret a thing though.

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I share many memorable moments with my water polo teammates competing in tournaments throughout Asia in countries including Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
Other than my classes and CS10 lab assisting, I volunteer at the UC Botanical Garden, work in 2 Biology undergraduate research labs, and am the secretary of the Thai Student Association here in Berkeley.
