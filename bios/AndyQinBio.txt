- Where did you grow up? What was your path to Cal? 

My story begins in Austin Texas, where I was born and raised for the first 13 years of my life. After Texas, my family and I packed our bags and headed to a city in SoCal called Arcadia (pop. 54,000). People usually know Arcadia by its band program, cross country team, or its big annual track meet.

I was largely drawn to Cal by its hacker culture and proximity to Silicon Valley, the only place it seems, where technological progress is unbounded. It was by Spring semester that I had really found my stride here, and I fully believe there is no better school for me.

- How much programming have you done (& what languages)?

I really started programming in Fall 2012 in CS10, and since then, I've programmed in Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and of course, BYOB/Snap!. It's been a whirlwind of a year, to start from knowing little to nothing about programming to doing research and development for my first CS class. You never forget your first one, I guess.

- What are your hobbies?
On the side, I enjoy hacking, reading about the future, racing go-karts, and playing basketball and golf. 

This semester, I'm picking up Ukelele and the game of Chess as two more hobbies of mine, if you have any pointers on those for me, don't be shy to contact me! 

- Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything memorable happened to you?

I think some of the most remarkable work I've been doing is for this class (shameless plug). There is a research group for this class, whose objectives are to develop the Snap! programming language and to convert CS10 to a massively open online course (MOOC), so that anyone with an internet connection can take it. 

I'd like to think I've been doing more good things than otherwise, but this is the first time it's ever been on the scale of the hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions. If you're passionate about the online education revolution, you can contact me about joining this group, we do important work and have a lot of fun.

- What commitments will be consuming your cycles this semester?

Other than helping teach CS10, I'll be taking 17 units, captaining an IM basketball team, doing some BJC research (see above), and working on a personal project involving CS education. Sounds like it's going to be great.
