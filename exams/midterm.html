<h4>Material Coverage</h4>
The midterm will test material covered since the beginning of the semester until week 9 (inclusive) -- everything we have done in class (readings, lectures, labs,
homework) up through, except what was covered <em>only</em> in discussion.

<h4>Administration</h4>
The midterm will be administered in <em>two</em> parts, a <em>with-Snap!</em>
part (worth 10 points) and a traditional, paper part worth 50 points.
The first <em>with-Snap!</em> part will be administered
<strong>during the lab section that you assigned to attend</strong>.
(Please see Piazza for the details of lab assignments for the midterm.) Lab
starts at 10m after the hour, and you will begin your lab by filling out a feedback
survey. At 30m after the hour you will be handed a single question and you will
have 90m to work on it (until lab ends). For example, if you
attend the 11am to 1pm section, the survey will be completed between 11:10am and
11:30am, and the <em>with-Snap!</em> part of your midterm will be administered between 11:30am and 1pm.
The first part of the midterm will be done on the computer, and you will each sit one computer
per student. You will submit your final answers on <a href="http://bcourses.berkeley.edu">bCourses</a>. 
Please note, that you may <strong>not</strong> use any outside materials (cheat sheets, labs, notes, etc) during the
online portion of the midterm. Unlike lab, we cannot allow collaboration on a test.

<br/><br/>

The second part (the "paper midterm") will be administered at the time and place listed on the course webpage.
It will be done on paper, and we will provide a list of the blocks you will need to
answer any questions. (There is no need to memorize a list of blocks, but you should
be comfortable using the blocks you've seen from labs and homework.) The style
of this part of the midterm will be similar to the Quest: we will ask you
questions on the readings, on various concepts, and on programming in Snap!.
You are allowed <strong>two</strong> notes sheets. They may be 8.5" x 11", handwritten
on both sides.

<br/><br/>

Please let the staff know if you have a legitimate conflict with the times of the midterm
administrations so that we can make alternate arrangements.  Please let us know by
the deadline listed on the corresponding Piazza post; we cannot help you if you inform us the day before the midterm.


<h4>Review Session</h4>
There will be a review session for the midterm, time and place listed on the course calendar.
<!-- The presentation
from the review session is available <a href="http://bit.ly/a3YV0Q"

<h4>Preparation</h4>
First off, don't panic!  Drink some chamomile tea, take a deep breath, and maybe even
<a href="http://xkcd.com/135/" style="text-decoration: none;">read this
comic strip</a>.  Work through the labs and homework once again, and ask questions if anything
is unclear.  We have also posted previous Midterms below. You may find them useful to get a sense
of how the midterm will be structured and what may be on it.
